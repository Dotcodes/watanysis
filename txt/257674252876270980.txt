Maybe a contact form?
11/13/16, 8:09 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Solo learn should have these kind of group shouldnt it itself is a group but still that would be lot more easy
11/13/16, 8:10 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Oh contact form great idea
11/13/16, 8:10 PM - steven newzealand: I can set up the page for the contact form, if you want.

Just tell me how it needs to look.
11/13/16, 8:11 PM - Naveen DA: guys checkout this jquery plugin, which makes you contact form more fun https://kushagragour.in/lab/superplaceholderjs/
11/13/16, 8:12 PM - steven newzealand: Thing is:
I can't make it work. Like, when someone contacts you, I can't make it that it sends an message/email.
11/13/16, 8:13 PM - steven newzealand: I can onky make thw page look cool.
11/13/16, 8:13 PM - steven newzealand: Sorry.
11/13/16, 8:15 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Yes but web languages are supposed to just do this to add other function you need to add other programs at the host computer need to learn programming languages
11/13/16, 8:18 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: The form can send all the data in specified method which can be used to do whatever processing you are thinking of for example it can post through CGI at specified url and CGI can be read handled store your data through a c++ program they are good for this method
11/13/16, 8:19 PM - steven newzealand: I didn't learn C++ yet. I can only do HTML so far
11/13/16, 8:20 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Oh well CGI commands may not be taught at solo learn as they are not counted in basics however CGI is very simple
11/13/16, 8:20 PM - Naveen DA: @lottan he is a 17years old kit,  and he is just a beginner
11/13/16, 8:20 PM - Naveen DA: kid
11/13/16, 8:21 PM - steven newzealand: I started learning yesterday

11/13/16, 8:21 PM - steven newzealand: Okay
11/13/16, 8:22 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Websites like Facebook do this via php language
11/13/16, 8:22 PM - ‪+49 1575 2196506‬: Java,jscript and a little style
11/13/16, 8:22 PM - steven newzealand: Okay.

11/13/16, 8:26 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Html does not have anything like fetching information from inputs verifying input changing content of it after it has finished loading and seen. You need other things to do this html just provides framework for these languages to work. It just tells the browser how will the page look like if you are able to make input boxes with cool styles it is more than enough
11/13/16, 8:28 PM - steven newzealand: Ah okay. I get it.

So you need other languages to know, then just HTML
11/13/16, 8:29 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Yes I was just coining examples to help you understand better those short froms were not to scare you friend
11/13/16, 8:29 PM - ‪+49 1575 2196506‬: We have to develope an idea first, then look at the required languages.
11/13/16, 8:29 PM - steven newzealand: Your right, Maxim.
11/13/16, 8:30 PM - Naveen DA: simily steven
HTML= skeleton
CSS= skin
JS= muscle
SOLE= server side script language
it may be jsp, node.js,php, ruby, etc
11/13/16, 8:30 PM - steven newzealand: So, is this a group about helping each other, or are we going to combine our knowledge into a website?
11/13/16, 8:30 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: I recommend you Steven to finish html first then think of other language you are done with making a form try something other simple thing handling form information dies not come in html
11/13/16, 8:31 PM - steven newzealand: Ok
11/13/16, 8:31 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: It will not distract you from learning
11/13/16, 8:32 PM - steven newzealand: Okay, but one problem...

I think HTML is the only easy language for me.
11/13/16, 8:32 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Do you have any other curiosities related to html I will not answer in scary acronyms don't worry... Lol
11/13/16, 8:33 PM - steven newzealand: Lol, actually, I don't. My curiosity is at HTML only
11/13/16, 8:34 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: You can try to make articles of different styles in html if you have got enough tags
11/13/16, 8:35 PM - steven newzealand: I know a lot of tags
11/13/16, 8:35 PM - Naveen DA: so then move css
11/13/16, 8:35 PM - Naveen DA: its also. very easy
11/13/16, 8:35 PM - steven newzealand: Will try, thank you
11/13/16, 8:35 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Yes Naveen is righr
11/13/16, 8:35 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Right
11/13/16, 8:36 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: CSS is just easy as html once you get how to select elements it's even easier than html
11/13/16, 8:37 PM - steven newzealand: Okay, I'll get on it
11/13/16, 8:38 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: If you face problem remembering the names used in properties then write it in notepad ++
11/13/16, 8:38 PM - steven newzealand: Ok will do
11/13/16, 8:39 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Your html might not be showing cool you can change color size spacing but CSS will make it even better
11/13/16, 8:39 PM - Naveen DA: use my project for bootstrap code https://github.com/Dotcodes/Boot-hint
11/13/16, 8:40 PM - steven newzealand: Okay. But shus, @919702012264 was typing
11/13/16, 8:40 PM - ‪+91 97020 12264‬: I beginner in computer programming. I don't  know where to starting learning. Can any one help me?
11/13/16, 8:40 PM - ‪+91 97020 12264‬: I beginner in computer programming. I don't  know where to starting learning. Can any one help me?
11/13/16, 8:41 PM - steven newzealand: Okay nvm then😂
11/13/16, 8:41 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Your input for example will get color of your choice borders rings
11/13/16, 8:41 PM - steven newzealand: Oopa
11/13/16, 8:41 PM - Naveen DA: go though w3w3schools.com
11/13/16, 8:42 PM - Naveen DA: w3schools.com
11/13/16, 8:42 PM - steven newzealand: I should start with HTML. It's very easy. Then move over to CSS, just like what Naveen and Lotan said.
11/13/16, 8:43 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: If you write codes in notepad then its perfect I to do this once I have learnt. The reason I suggested that it automatically completes the name of tags properties and help new coders when I learnt some more I will switch back too it as it's meant for projects large ones
11/13/16, 8:44 PM - steven newzealand: Ok
11/13/16, 8:44 PM - steven newzealand: But I will try CSS. Thanks for mentioning it
11/13/16, 8:45 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: I assumed you have already notepad ++ I used it when I faces problem remembering languages exact names
11/13/16, 8:45 PM - steven newzealand: I don't have notepad++
I wrote it down with pen and paper
11/13/16, 8:46 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Then better don't use it it will be extra headache of setting up installing
11/13/16, 8:46 PM - steven newzealand: Lol okay

11/14/16, 5:38 PM - steven newzealand: It's pretty easy, but I will need to practice it
11/14/16, 5:39 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Try making animated buttons buttons which change color etc
11/14/16, 5:40 PM - ‪+91 98299 05512‬: Html and css is easy just use id and classes , and as you practice you can remember css popular property too
11/14/16, 5:40 PM - steven newzealand: I can't do that yet
11/14/16, 5:40 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: You said to change subject but we are still talking about old topics
Let's bring some new ideas
11/14/16, 5:40 PM - ‪+91 98299 05512‬: Like black color button and as u put mouse curson there ir changes to anyother color ?
11/14/16, 5:42 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Yes
You can do that button:hover{
Background: green;
}
And adding transition to it will provide the effect animated
11/14/16, 5:42 PM - ‪+91 98299 05512‬: Yep
11/14/16, 5:43 PM - ‪+91 98299 05512‬: But ;_; any idea how can we change color automatically after some specific period 😆
11/14/16, 5:45 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Yes that's button{
Background: black:
Animation: changecolor 3s liner;
Animatiom-delay:1s;}
11/14/16, 5:46 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Then
@keyframes changecolor {
100% {background:green} }
11/14/16, 5:47 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: You meant not on its own but after putting mouse pointer there that's what I said to add transition wait...
11/14/16, 5:48 PM - ‪+91 98299 05512‬: Wew illl try that
11/14/16, 5:50 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Button{
Background: black; transition: background 3s linear;
Transition-delay: 1s;
}

Bacground: green;
}

11/14/16, 7:43 PM - steven newzealand: With local files, you need the code to be in the exact same file map as the picture, in order to make it work.

11/14/16, 8:50 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: You can change that button like other buttons and hide other things and add a indicator text div next to it
11/14/16, 8:53 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: We can't handle much about it you know it's a sensitive thing from view of security so browser itself copies the file temporarily and send neither scripts nor style nor the rules can be changed
11/14/16, 8:53 PM - Naveen DA: <Media omitted>
11/14/16, 8:54 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: That's called textarea

}
11/14/16, 9:02 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: You can log the event and check out the console you will be amazed to see how tight security browsers do
11/14/16, 9:03 PM - Naveen DA: extaclly but <label for="status photo">
11/14/16, 9:04 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: I have seen in it chrome it adds to its threads and display the path as c:/fakepat I thought it adds to filesyst but no it temporarily stores in thread
11/14/16, 9:05 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: But some Google site can access anything like a native page of it that's because they are whitelisted
11/14/16, 9:05 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Ok
11/14/16, 9:08 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: If you are generating preview of your own style in a local file then you can't because block such requests of reading the chosen file websites do this by uploading and then sending the created preview to you I don't know exactly how they do so
11/14/16, 9:09 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: So you are done is your question is the make a file chooser exactly like this
11/14/16, 9:09 PM - Naveen DA: no
11/14/16, 9:10 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: If you are generating preview of your own style in a local file then you can't because browser block such requests of reading the chosen file websites do this by uploading and then sending the created preview to you I don't know exactly how they do so
11/14/16, 9:10 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Then what is your question 😀
11/14/16, 9:10 PM - Naveen DA: wait wait i will there

11/15/16, 1:48 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: But the method which I use most is by converting a web project into .apk file you have to specify a index.html which will become main activity
This is easy as html CSS etc are all easy
There are tools to do that
11/15/16, 1:50 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Apps made modifying project folder in android studio
As told by the tutorial I renamed some details in manifest file then made button labels in XML and added a java class
11/15/16, 1:51 PM - ‪+880 1759-998041‬: Simply great.
11/15/16, 1:51 PM - ‪+880 1759-998041‬: i didn't knew about it
11/15/16, 1:51 PM - ‪+880 1759-998041‬: So we can convert web apps to Android apps
11/15/16, 1:51 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: These apps are not so great they are just extension of hello world example says name randomly calculate sum difference and I have made a app which outputs toasts of given input
11/15/16, 1:52 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Yes there is adobe services for that too
11/15/16, 1:52 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: But you will learn anything how apps work
11/15/16, 1:53 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: I prefer it because I don't know advanced Java and here I have some knowledge of js html CSS to do the work
11/15/16, 1:54 PM - ‪+880 1759-998041‬: okay, im not really sure about my programming career , I want something more dramatic.

11/15/16, 1:58 PM - ‪+880 1759-998041‬: androis is awesome.  But the real problem is piracy.

11/15/16, 2:14 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: I think you should say you need iOS for swift
11/15/16, 2:15 PM - ‪+91 96083 85176‬: Because I heard they can be made using c# too so perhaps not swift for ios
